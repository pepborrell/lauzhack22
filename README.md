# Queued
A better way to share music with your friends.

This project got selected to be showcased in the final LauzHack 2022 presentation.

## Why?
We love music and we love to share it. But when we have a new tune that we want to share with our friends, there is no straightforward way of doing so. A spotify link on a text often gets lost in a conversation. An instagram story is fleeting. The current platforms don't offer a way to share songs that is convenient for both the sender and receiver.

## What is this then?
In this hackathon we put together a personal queue that all your friends can share songs with. The queue shows all the tunes you haven't listened to yet, so you can choose when and where to listen to them.

This is a simple prototype. It's hosted locally and requires users to send spotify links to a queue.

## Next steps
* Properly hosting the project
* Adding new music sources (Apple music, Youtube...)
* Adding broadcasts to followers, not only personal recommendations
